<h1>Skills and Tasks Demonstrated</h1>

<h2>Penetration Testing Methodology:</h2>

<b>Planning and Reconnaissance:</b> Conducted a comprehensive assessment of Alex Financeâ€™s server, including initial reconnaissance to gather information about the target.

<b>Network Scanning and Enumeration:</b> Employed tools like Nmap and OpenVAS to identify open ports, services, and vulnerabilities on the target system.

<h2>Vulnerability Assessment:</h2>

<b>Port Scanning:</b>  Utilized Nmap to discover open ports and their associated services, such as SSH, HTTP, and MySQL.

<b>Vulnerability Scanning:</b>  Used OpenVAS to perform a detailed scan of the system to identify high, medium, and low-severity vulnerabilities.

<h2>Exploitation of Vulnerabilities:</h2>

<b>Directory Listing and Enumeration:</b>  Identified and exploited directory listing vulnerabilities to discover sensitive files and credentials.

<b>SSH User Enumeration:</b>  Used searchsploit and custom scripts to enumerate SSH usernames and assess the security of SSH configurations.

<b>Password Brute Forcing:</b>  Implemented brute-force attacks to crack weak SSH passwords using tools like ncrack.

<b>Weak Hashing:</b>  Identified and exploited weak MD5 password hashes, demonstrating the vulnerabilities of outdated hashing algorithms.

<b>Code Injection:</b>  Discovered and exploited code injection vulnerabilities in web applications.

<b>Improper Authentication:</b>  Detected and exploited improper authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to the database.

<h2>Mitigation and Remediation:</h2>

<b>Vulnerability Mitigation:</b>  Proposed solutions for each identified vulnerability, such as disabling directory listings, implementing multi-factor authentication, and upgrading hashing algorithms.

<b>Secure Protocols:</b>  Recommended the use of HTTPS and other secure protocols to protect data in transit.

<b>Intrusion Detection:</b>  Suggested deploying intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) and other monitoring tools to enhance security.

<h2>Privilege Escalation:</h2>

<b>SUID Binaries:</b>  Identified and exploited SUID (Set User ID) binaries to escalate privileges and gain root access on the target system.

<b>Password Hashing and Shadow File Manipulation:</b>  Demonstrated techniques for modifying the shadow file to escalate privileges.

<h2>Management:</h2>

<b>Detailed Reporting:</b>  Created a comprehensive report documenting the penetration testing process, including vulnerabilities found, exploitation methods, and remediation recommendations.

<b>Visual Aids:</b>  Included figures and diagrams to support findings and illustrate the scanning results, vulnerability details, and exploitation techniques.

<h2>Technical Skills:</h2>

<b>Tool Proficiency:</b>  Demonstrated proficiency with various security tools and techniques, including Nmap, OpenVAS, searchsploit, ncrack, hashcat, and Wireshark.

<b>Command-Line Operations:</b>  Executed complex commands and scripts for vulnerability assessment and exploitation.

<h2>Summary of Actions</h2>

<b>Initial Assessment:</b>  Conducted a gray-box penetration test on Alex Finance's server, systematically identifying and assessing vulnerabilities.

<b>Scanning and Enumeration:</b>  Performed network and vulnerability scanning to discover potential weaknesses and security issues.


<b>Exploitation:</b>  Exploited identified vulnerabilities, including directory listings, weak hashes, SSH brute force, and improper authentication.

<b>Mitigation:</b>  Provided detailed recommendations to mitigate the discovered vulnerabilities and improve overall security posture.

<b>Privilege Escalation:</b>  Demonstrated methods for escalating privileges on the target system through SUID binaries and manipulation of password hashes.

<b>Reporting:</b>  Documented findings and provided actionable recommendations to enhance security.
Overall, the write-up reflects a thorough understanding of penetration testing processes, vulnerability assessment, exploitation techniques, and effective remediation strategies, as well as strong teamwork and communication skills.
