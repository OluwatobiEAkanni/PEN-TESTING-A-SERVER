Skills and Tasks Demonstrated
Penetration Testing Methodology:

Planning and Reconnaissance: Conducted a comprehensive assessment of Alex Finance’s server, including initial reconnaissance to gather information about the target.
Network Scanning and Enumeration: Employed tools like Nmap and OpenVAS to identify open ports, services, and vulnerabilities on the target system.
Vulnerability Assessment:

Port Scanning: Utilized Nmap to discover open ports and their associated services, such as SSH, HTTP, and MySQL.
Vulnerability Scanning: Used OpenVAS to perform a detailed scan of the system to identify high, medium, and low-severity vulnerabilities.
Exploitation of Vulnerabilities:

Directory Listing and Enumeration: Identified and exploited directory listing vulnerabilities to discover sensitive files and credentials.
SSH User Enumeration: Used searchsploit and custom scripts to enumerate SSH usernames and assess the security of SSH configurations.
Password Brute Forcing: Implemented brute-force attacks to crack weak SSH passwords using tools like ncrack.
Weak Hashing: Identified and exploited weak MD5 password hashes, demonstrating the vulnerabilities of outdated hashing algorithms.
Code Injection: Discovered and exploited code injection vulnerabilities in web applications.
Improper Authentication: Detected and exploited improper authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to the database.
Mitigation and Remediation:

Vulnerability Mitigation: Proposed solutions for each identified vulnerability, such as disabling directory listings, implementing multi-factor authentication, and upgrading hashing algorithms.
Secure Protocols: Recommended the use of HTTPS and other secure protocols to protect data in transit.
Intrusion Detection: Suggested deploying intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) and other monitoring tools to enhance security.
Privilege Escalation:

SUID Binaries: Identified and exploited SUID (Set User ID) binaries to escalate privileges and gain root access on the target system.
Password Hashing and Shadow File Manipulation: Demonstrated techniques for modifying the shadow file to escalate privileges.
Group Management:

Team Collaboration: Effectively managed group work, including division of tasks, communication using tools like Canvas, WhatsApp, and Zoom, and ensuring all team members contributed to the project’s success.
Reporting and Documentation:

Detailed Reporting: Created a comprehensive report documenting the penetration testing process, including vulnerabilities found, exploitation methods, and remediation recommendations.
Visual Aids: Included figures and diagrams to support findings and illustrate the scanning results, vulnerability details, and exploitation techniques.
Technical Skills:

Tool Proficiency: Demonstrated proficiency with various security tools and techniques, including Nmap, OpenVAS, searchsploit, ncrack, hashcat, and Wireshark.
Command-Line Operations: Executed complex commands and scripts for vulnerability assessment and exploitation.
Summary of Actions
Initial Assessment: Conducted a gray-box penetration test on Alex Finance's server, systematically identifying and assessing vulnerabilities.
